            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The aim of this project is to design and implement a full-stack web application for the processing of historical handwritten and printed encrypted texts together with handwritten cipher key documents. These sources include cipher keys, fully encrypted texts, semi-encrypted texts, and mixed pages where both keys and texts appear together. The application should provide researchers and students with modern tools for digital preservation, pre-processing, annotation, recognition, reconstruction, symbol mapping, and decryption, all within a single collaborative platform.

            <h2>System Description</h2>
            <p>
                The system is expected to cover the entire workflow from uploading digitized images to creating machine-readable editions that can be directly applied to decipher encrypted texts. It should allow multi-level annotation of regions, entries, and symbols, enabling users to highlight areas of interest, classify symbols, reconstruct substitution tables, and link plaintext with ciphertext.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Study the domain</strong> - research encrypted texts, cipher keys, AI and non-AI methods, and preprocessing techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Design the system</strong> - define requirements, architecture, user management, sharing, credits, and virtual points.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan the project</strong> - prepare timeline, milestones, assign roles, set up tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Model the system</strong> - create UML diagrams and database schemas.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement the application</strong> - build backend, frontend, preprocessing, AI and non-AI modules, reconstruction, user management, sharing, credits, and virtual points.</li>
                <li><strong>Test the system</strong> - perform unit, integration, and system tests; compare AI and non-AI methods; evaluate reconstruction and decryption on synthetic and historical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Write documentation</strong> - prepare user guides, technical documentation, and the final report.</li>

            <p>
                The final outcome of the project will be a cloud-deployed, production-ready application that integrates pre-processing, annotation, recognition, reconstruction, decryption, and collaborative features, including user management, document sharing, credits, and virtual points. It will also include both AI and non-AI methods, a demonstrator dataset of annotated pages, and comprehensive documentation.
