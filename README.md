# CoP-DDAHC Project website
This repository contains the source code for the CoP-DDAHC project website, which provides information about the Collaborative Platform for Digitalisation, Decryption, and Annotation of Historical Ciphers (CoP-DDAHC) project.

It will be periodically updated by adding meeting minutes and updates about the project progress.

#### Project Description
You can read more about the project on the website. The whole assignment description is also available in the [assignment.md](assignment.md) file.

Meeting minutes are downloadable directly from the website or from the [meeting-minutes](meeting-minutes) folder.

#### Website Technologies
The website is built using plain HTML and JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, and custom CSS. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

#### Disclaimer
The meeting minutes template ([_template.md](minutes/_template.md)) and example meeting-minutes in the same folder were for now created with the assistance of LLM - Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic).
They will be removed and manually created in the future.
