The aim of the project was to design and implement a comprehensive full-stack web application for processing historical encrypted texts and documents containing cipher keys. The application covered the entire workflow from uploading digitized images through preprocessing, annotation, recognition, and reconstruction up to the actual decryption. The designed system combined artificial intelligence methods (handwriting recognition, symbol detection, table reconstruction) with heuristic approaches (morphological operations, contour analysis, rule-based algorithms) and provided users with a unified symbol database for mapping and applying cipher keys. The platform also supported collaboration, user management with different roles, document sharing, and a system of credits and points for contributions. The outcome of the project was a cloud-deployed application that offered modern tools for research, digitization, and decryption of historical encrypted materials, while also creating a collaborative environment for researchers and students.
